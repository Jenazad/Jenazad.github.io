The system Python 3 stack has been upgraded to Python 3.6.1, and includes a backport of Python 3.7's C locale coercion feature (where the ASCII-based C locale is replaced with C.UTF-8 at interpreter startup, which is expected to significantly reduce the occurrence of unwanted Unicode encoding and decoding errors).
