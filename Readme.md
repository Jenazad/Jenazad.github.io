=====================
This is my website developed on jekyll and ruby.

You can see the documentation about [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or [github pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/).

You can take this web like a demo that was created by [Jenazad](https://github.com/Jenazad/) and see how configure your own jekyll website on [your localhost](https://github.com/Jenazad/developConfig/tree/master/ruby).

Users are free to copy and re-use any and all of the code contained here without contacting me.
